I've decided to select slide 16, namely "Estimating π with 
Numerical Integration"

The history of π and it's approximations dates back to ancient
Babylonians, which approximated π to equal 3, almost 4000 years
ago.

Knowing that the quest to find the true value of π dates back to
multiple thousands of years ago, there is certainly no wonder that
the methods of approximation have improved over the years.

The method stated in slide 16 uses numerical integration making use of
Riemann sums, developed by the German mathematician Bernhard Riamann
(1826-1866). Its usage was never intended to be a way of estimating π,
rather as a way to approximate the value of integrals. Thus, there is
no exact credited person for this π-estimation-approach.

Since the Integral from 0 to 1 of the Riemann sums is equal to π/4,
this means that we could theoretically compute the approximation of π 
as close to π's real value as we wanted to, by splitting and summing up
as many even-length slices of the function f(x) = 1/(1+x*x) within the
range of 0 to 1 as we would need for the preferred calculation preciseness.

*Why is the integral of 1/(1+x*x) = π/4?
-> as F(x) = arctan(x) + C
-> the integral of arctan(x) = π/4

Furthermore, this method can also be referred to as the midpoint Riemann sum,
since we are using the middle of the length of our segments to calculate
the height needed for each rectangle that we split the function into.
