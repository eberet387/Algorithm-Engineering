->  Intel VTune Amplifier (Slide 11)

As we already know from the Slide, Intel VTune Amplifier helps us:
- diagnose performance metrics in an application such as
    - CPI,
    - thread concurrency,
    - cache misses #
    - achieved memory bandwidth
    - ...
- detect hotspots / bottlenecks

However, Intel VTune Amplifier is also able to:
- visualize most information in graphs
- find hardware-specific microarchitecture issues 
- examine bottlenecks in how the hardware processes I/O traffic
- help in power consumption and thermal-related throttling
- find GPU-bound hotspots
- show data transfer rates between components such as the DDR memory
- help visualize big, multi-node workloads including OpenMP or MPI

Background information: the Intel VTune Amplifier..
- is not limited to C++, as it supports other
  languages such as:
    - C,
    - C#,
    - Fortran,
    - Python, ...
- has been renamed to Intel VTune Profiler as of version 2022
- is still updated as of today
- the current stable release is 2025.0.1
- was first released in the year 2000
- has integration into popular IDEs like Visual Studio
- also works as a CLI tool
- is included in Intel's OneAPI toolkit
- has a Free Community license 

Funnily enough, most tools of Intel VTune Amplifier also work on AMD CPUs.
