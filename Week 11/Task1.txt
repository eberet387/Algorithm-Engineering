Additional Info on SSD Usage:
- It is recommended to keep at least 25% of the SSD space empty
as partially filled blocks would cause existing data to be deleted, 
which is why the SSD needs to perform extra steps like reading values
into it's cache. modifying those values and rewriting the entire
block to write files (also known as write amplification). This
will not only cause increased latency, but also more wear-and-tear 
as otherwise not needed actions are now being performed.
- Manufacturers sometimes reserve a few % of the SSD's space to 
mitigate the negative impacts of almost fully filled SSD's.
- There is no way to accurately calculate exactly how much space you
are able to use without great performance deficits.
- However, there are also user tests which show that a free space 
percentage of 50% can already substantially decrease performance by
making the SSD unable to perform at the max read/write speeds at all
times and therefore fluctuating between both high and low speeds.
- The same test concludes that a 90% filled SSD is bound to it's lower
end of performance, only reaching it's former max performance for small
batches of data.
- While not really on-topic, this sort of SSD-optimization by removing
not needed data reminds me of the manual boot-partition optimizations
of HDDs, where people would manually create partitions so that the boot
partition of a drive would land close to the outer side of the disk,
where the rotational speeds are higher than inside, creating higher
read/write speeds.
- In my opinion, the importance of this is not as significant as other
optimizations, as normal consumers would likely just buy a new, bigger
size SSD when they reach close to their maximum storage.
