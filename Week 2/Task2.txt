-> Explain in detail the figure Performance gains after Mooreâ€™s
law ends. 

The performance gain trend of Moore's law (doubling the 
number of transistors on computer chips every 2 years) will
most likely come to an end soon, as further miniaturization
gets more and more costly. The figure tells the reader that
after Moore's law has stopped, most of the performance gains
are deemed to be made by the "Top" of the computing stack,
namely software, algorithm and hardware architecture, as 
opposed to the "Bottom" - through new and advanced
semiconductor technology.

On the software-side, performance gains will be made through
optimization, by reducing inefficiencies in the form of bloat
for example, making sure that everything is stored cache-
friendly, and exploiting certain hardware features like paralellisms, tailoring the software more to the machine
it operates on. The figure calls this procedure "Software
performance engineering"

Algorithms on the other hand will also play a big role in
improving computing power, as newer Algorithms will be 
enhancing problem-solving efficiency and scalability by reducing
time- and space-complexity - enabling the computer to perform 
calculations or simulations faster through new problem domains
and machine models as an example.

A big opportunity of hardware architecture optimization, as the
figure describes, is hardware streamlining by simplifying 
the cores of processors, enabling more cores to fit onto the same
chip and focusing on reducing unnecessary hardware funcionality
for the desired domain, which is also called domain specialization.

All in all, the future computing power improvements will be more
sporadic as we can not rely on Moore's law to last forever, as
miniaturization will be subject to diminishing return over time. 
Hence, noticable performance gains will shift to the top of the 
computing stack and will be more sporadic and uneven, as big
breakthroughs in algorithms, software and hardware architecture
cannot be foreseen.
