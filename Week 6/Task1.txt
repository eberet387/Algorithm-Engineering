->  Name some characteristics of the instructions sets: SSE,
    AVX(2) and AVX-512.

SSE:
    -> Introduced in 1999
    -> 16 128-bit vector registers
    -> registers are named from XMM0 to XMM15
    -> 128-bit SIMD parallelism
    -> supports float and integer (added in SSE2) data + instructions

AVX(2):
    -> also known as "Haswell New Instructions"
    -> Introduced in 2013
    -> 16 256-bit vector registers
    -> registeres are named from YMM0 to YMM15
    -> supports both 128-bit and 256-bit parallelism
    -> supports float and integer data + instructions

AVX-512:
    -> introduced in 2016
    -> 32 512-bit vector registers
    -> registers are named from ZMM0 to ZMM31
    -> supports write masking 
    (individual elements of the vector can be written / changed
    according to a bit mask)
    -> there are 8 64-bit mask registers named K0 to K7
    -> supports memory fault suppression
    (if loading something from memory causes the virtual address
    to exceed the allocated memory range / or memory has already
    been freed, AVX-512 can mask out the bytes that are faulty.)
    -> variety of Integer / Float instructions
