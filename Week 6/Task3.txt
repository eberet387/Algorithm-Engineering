->  What are the advantages of unit stride (stride-1) memory
    access compared to accessing memory with larger strides 
    (for example, stride-8)?

Advantages:
    -> stride-1 offers the lowest distance between the
    accessed memory
    -> therefore offers the best cache efficiency of all
    strides as a single cache line fetches only needed
    elements
    -> access latency is minimized because the memory lines 
    are contiguous 
    -> allows efficient vectorization as larger strides
    have difficulties with or may even prevent vectorization,
    and causes reduced efficiency in SIMD usage
