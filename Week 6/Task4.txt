->  When would you prefer arranging records in memory as a
    Structure of Arrays?

When:
    -> performance optimizations are important, 
    -> you want to be able to vectorize efficiently,
    -> SIMD is used,
    -> cache efficiency is important,
    -> many calculations are performend on a field-basis
    (i.e. prices of all products need to be transformend)
