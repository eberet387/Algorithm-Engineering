->  How do bandwidth-bound computations differ from
    compute-bound computations?

Bandwidth-Bound Computations:
    - computations, that are bottlenecked by memory accesss
    - therefore, memory bandwidth is the main factor of the
    bottleneck
    - mostly found when working with large datasets, sparse 
    matrix operations and anywhere, where data transfer
    between memory and processor are a key factor
    -> CPU / GPU spends more time waiting for actual data
    (fetching) than computing
    -> performance gains depend mostly on bandwidth upgrades

Compute-Bound Computations:
    - computations, that are bottlenecked by computations
    - therefore, the CPU is the main factor of the bottleneck
    - mostly found in simulations of all sorts (scientific,
    graphic, economic), dense matrix operations, as well as
    general algorithms, where calculations form most of the
    workload
    -> CPU / GPU spends the most time computing, while fetching
    data is only a small portion of the workload.
    -> performance gains depend mostly on CPU / GPU upgrades
    (or more efficient algorithms of course)
